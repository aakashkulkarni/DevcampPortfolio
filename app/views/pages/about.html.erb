<h2>Me</h2>
<p>I'm Aakash, I study at Hillcrest High School. I love math, physics, coding, and every sport. With over 10 hours of videos on Math watched, you can trust me that I will give the right answer. I work hard, and daily, and the thing that keeps me going is my passion for this stuff. Thanks for visiting, though!</p><br>
